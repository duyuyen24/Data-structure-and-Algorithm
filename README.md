# Data structure and Algorithm

## **ALGORITHM LEARNING PROCESS for Intermediate Levels**

### WEEK 1

Learn the method and how to mark assignments online using the homework.
Learn how to evaluate and analyze the complexity of the Algorithmic Complexity (Algorithmic Complexity) to determine which Algorithm is best suited to solving a particular issue.

### WEEK 2

Get familiar with Linked List data structures and Sorting algorithms.
Learn about the STL ( Standard Template Library ) library's core Data structures and Algorithm. 
Sorting, Stack & Queue, and String are all terms that may be used to describe how data is organized. Applying to actual problems such as:

### WEEK 3
Review the knowledge learned and  take part in self-created contests (including practical problems on CodeForces, HackerRank, Aizu, SPOJ, UVA, CodeChef)

>[Concerning Contest 3](https://vjudge.net/contest/444307)

>[Given Contest 4](https://vjudge.net/contest/444768)

### WEEK 4

Develop an understanding of graph (Graph)-related algorithms including Breadth-first search(BFS) and Depth first search(DFS). 
This is a highly significant piece of information that is frequently utilized in the domains of Data, AI, and many others such as road and traffic problems.

>[Regarding the DFS'issues](https://vjudge.net/contest/446128)

### WEEK 5

As part of implementing the Heap (minHeap and maxHeap), the program builds a priority queue in order to simplify the pathfinding algorithms.
Learn about Dijkstra's Shortest Path Search Algorithm (Graph), which is implemented using a priority queue. Solve the problem as below

### WEEK 6
Continue to become acquainted with graph-related algorithms (Graph) (Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall). Find solutions to actual issues as below

>[About the Bellman-Ford's problem](https://vjudge.net/contest/448367)

>[On the topics of Floyd-Warshall](https://vjudge.net/contest/448523)

### WEEK 7
Find all about search algorithms including Linear Search and Binary Search. Learn about tree Data structures linked to Binary Search Trees. Solve real problems:
